## Project Context

This project combines soil units mapped and described by the NRCS and remotely-
sensed data to describe spatial patterns in plant species distribution and
traits on the Santa Rita Experimental Range.The aim of this analysis is to relate
soil physical and chemical properties to vegetation distribution and productivity
on at scales larger than the site-level.

## Hard Rules — Read These First


### 1. Data sources
Key data sources include SoilWeb (Web Soil Survey) data and NEON AOP products.

### 2. Credentials and secrets
All credentials must be read from environment variables. Never hard-code
any credential, API key, password, or token. See `.env.example` for the
full list of required environment variables.

### 3. Data files
The following directories are gitignored and must never be committed:
[LIST GITIGNORED DATA DIRECTORIES e.g. data/raw/, data/processed/]

The following directories are git-tracked:
[LIST TRACKED DIRECTORIES e.g. data/snapshots/, data/overrides/]

### 4. [ADD PROJECT-SPECIFIC HARD RULES AS NEEDED]

## Environment Variables

<!-- List all environment variables the project uses. Copy from .env.example. -->

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| [VARIABLE_NAME] | [Purpose] | [Default or "required"] |

---

## Pipeline Execution Order

<!-- If the project has numbered scripts, list them here with a one-line
     description of each. If not applicable, remove this section. -->

```
[01_script.R]   → [What it does]
[02_script.R]   → [What it does]
```

---

## Coding Conventions

### Language and style
- Primary language: R
- [Add style guide reference e.g. tidyverse style guide URL]
- [Add pipe preference e.g. use base R pipe |> not %>%]

### Package preferences
- [List preferred packages for data manipulation, plotting, etc.]
- Do not introduce new package dependencies without discussion

### Functions
- Every function must have documentation (roxygen2 for R, docstrings for Python)
- Every function must have at least one test
